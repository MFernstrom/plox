# PLOX

Plox is a FreePascal implementation of the lexers and parsers at https://craftinginterpreters.com/ for the language Lox, created by Bob Nystrom.

As a way to better understand how lexers and parsers work I'm working my way through the website and implementing the Java code as presented on the site, and also converting the code to a FreePascal implementation.

I'm opting to follow the structure as presented on the website by Bob Nystrom for most things, with just a few small changes and additions as needed.
